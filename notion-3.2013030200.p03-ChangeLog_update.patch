-(The ChangeLog will be generated by release scripts from svn logs)
+2013-03-02  Arnout Engelen  <arnouten@bzzt.net>
+
+	Much simpler release procedure due to recent improvements in project setup
+
+2013-02-03  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Reflect that mod_xrandr is now loaded by default
+
+	Enable mod_xrandr by default
+
+2013-01-03  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Only allow removal of last workspace if there are multiple screens
+	This is a more conservative version of
+	ca7765688c5532f55281089a66a42b176f7849e5: it preserves the behavior of
+	Ion3 in case there is a single screen.
+
+	But we still want to be able to remove the last workspace from a screen
+	if there are multiple screens: this is used in the redistribution of
+	workspaces on detaching and attaching screens.
+
+2013-01-03  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Prevent closing of last screen
+	In the absence of a screen, Notion seems to be irrecoverably broken and
+	needs to be restarted.
+
+2012-12-26  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Close watches along with screen
+	Attach the notifywin of screen 1 to screen 0 and close screen 1
+	(cfg_xrandr.lua triggers this behavior). Before, an orphaned notifywin
+	would survive and Notion would crash when trying to close it.
+
+	Fix typo in d7ec9e706e14f568cf025b1a3ffc280c9bad9ed6
+
+2012-12-23  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Update activity notification on reattaching
+	The region_set_activity(reg, SETPARAM_UNSET) in region_detach_manager
+	did not take care of clearing the activity notification on the old
+	screen because the attaching happens on the level of the WGroup, while
+	the activity flag is set on the client itself.
+
+	Closes
+	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3009515&group_id=314802&atid=1324528
+
+2012-12-18  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Revert "groupws_set_initial_outputs is not safe"
+	Unfortunately this breaks at least the screen_managed_changed_hook in
+	cfg_xrandr.lua and I don't see an immediate way around that.
+
+	This reverts commit 59976673d9d454378e7c722f38001434343e90d3.
+
+2012-12-18  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	groupws_set_initial_outputs is not safe
+
+2012-12-03  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Change documentation of WRegion.goto_
+
+2012-11-18  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	display -> goto_
+	Display is not a good name and goto_ is closest to what we have right
+	now.
+
+	Use StringIntMap for window_stacking_request
+
+2012-11-16  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	New versions of mod_xinerama and mod_xrandr
+
+	Make gcc happy by not mixing code and declarations
+
+2012-11-16  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>
+
+	added configuration option to allow the user to block responding to stacking events
+
+2012-10-26  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Revert "Update copyright header of de/fontset.c"
+	In fact src/Screen.cc of the Blackbox WM did contain the code in
+	question under the MIT license until
+	    revision 1.155
+	    date: 2002/10/22 09:42:44;  author: bradleyhughes;  state: Exp;  lines: +0 -204
+	    remove font loading from BScreen
+	See http://blackboxwm.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/blackboxwm/blackbox/
+
+	Thanks to Dima Kogan for pointing this out.
+
+	This reverts commit 47268089b00c88d16ed6827d172bf3a79a4b72b7.
+
+2012-10-06  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>

+
+	Enhance information on build dependencies
+
+2012-09-30  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Honor InputHint in accordance with ICCCM
+	This should fix problems with the keyboard focus in Java applications, see

+
+	New mod_xrandr
+
+	New contrib
+
+	Merge branch 'master' of ssh://notion.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/notion/notion
+
+	Make group_get_configuration available for use in group-ws
+
+	Manage and save list of preferred outputs for workspaces
+	In combination with mod_xrandr, this allows for saving information about
+	the screen output that a workspace was created on. This information is
+	used for moving the workspace to an appropriate location when
+	(un-)plugging a screen.

+
+	newer mod_notionflux (to be able to build with preloading modules again)
+

+	We achieve this by first unmanaging the stdisp.
+
+2012-08-05  Arnout  <arnouten@bzzt.net>
+
+	Allow profiling by google perftools (use -DENABLE_PROFILING at build time)

+
+	Merge branch 'master' of ssh://notion.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/notion/notion
+
+	Use META+(Shift+)scrollwheel to switch windows
+	Works nicely for the common cases where the mouse pointer is in the focused
+	window. When the mouse pointer is not in the focussed window, I'm not entirely
+	sure what behavior is desirable. Right now it scrolls through the tabs of the
+	frame with the mouse pointer for horizontal scrolling, and behaves somewhat
+	erratically for vertical scrolling.

+
+2012-07-26  Arnout Engelen  <arnouten@bzzt.net>
+
+	Make system.mk logic consistent
+
+	No longer suggest changing the LUA settings, these should be autodetected
+
+2012-07-26  Matthias Lederhofer  <matled@gmx.net>
+
+	add notes about getting and updating the source to README
+	I struggled a bit to update to the latest version of notion because
+	new submodules were added.  The natural place to look first was the
+	README file, which didn't tell anything about this problem, except for
+	the wiki link.  I think it would be nice to have a note about this in
+	the README.

+
+2012-06-05  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Update copyright header of de/fontset.c
+	Most of the code seems to be a verbatim copy of
+	<http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/intro-i18n/ch-examples.en.html#s13.4.5>
+	which is licensed under the GPL, so that we can hardly ship it with an
+	MIT license copyright header. I don't see any similarity whatsoever to
+	the the file "Screen.cc for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager" mentioned
+	in the header (which is indeed published under the MIT license). So I've
+	simply dropped the reference to the latter file and put this file under
+	the GPL.

+	Thanks Philipp for noticing. While XKB is strictly spoken an extension, it
+	looks like it has been available through the standard X libraries on all major

+	about Solaris. We can make this a system.mk option (default on) if this is a

+
+	Change handling of geometry of stdisp
+	Before we set the geometry of the stdisp to its correct target geometry.
+	This however renders the whole tiling inconsistent. Also taking into
+	account the geometry changes from mmoving away from the stdisp renders
+	the tiling inconsistent. We tried to counter this by calling
+	tiling_manage_stdisp, but it turns out that this is not good enough to
+	repair the tiling.
+
+	So now we resize the stdisp to the geometry that is necessary to keep
+	the tiling consistent and then call split_sanitize_stdisp. Also we only
+	use the geometry calculated for frames moving away from the stdisp for
+	updating the window informations, while using a fake geometry
+	information for the split without these changes. split_sanitize_stdisp
+	will then update the tiling in a way that again accomodates the frames
+	that are temporarily bigger than their surrounding splits. Still should
+	combine the advantages of using the correct geometry (which massively
+	avoids flickering in programs with resizing problems, notably ncurses
+	based ones) and of having consistent tiling (desirable for obvious
+	reasons).
+

+
+	Cleanup

+	Trivial typos, causing a lot of trouble

+
+	Support all horizontal stdisp's
+	Also rearrange most of the code.
+	TODO:
+	- If a vertically maximized frame is horizontally maximized and then
+	  restored, check that the saved geometry really fits over the stdisp.
+	- If a vertically maximized frame is horizontally restored, we adapt its
+	  height in case the stdisp is removed, but currently the
+	  FRAME_MAXED_VERT flag is lost in the process. Preserve it or set it
+	  again.
+
+2012-05-06  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Small cleanup
+
+	Handle case of non-fs, horiz. stdisp in bl corner
+	This seems to take care of the two problems mentioned in the message to
+	commit 8370a156ae6440e3983486ca4c7a167caf72cf25 in the special case that
+	the potential non-fullsized stdisp is positioned in the lower left
+	corner and has a horizontal orientation. This should be the most
+	commmon case. Adding support for other cases is not difficult (maybe a
+	horizontal stdisp in the upper left corner is not that uncommon?), but
+	it will only happen on request.
+
+2012-05-06  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Don't ignore the stdisp after all, use less precise verification
+	Removing and readding the stdisp had ugly side effects, like the
+	flickering I've been trying to address with several commits already. New
+	bugs kept showing up and the approach was getting more and more
+	complicated when I tried to fix them. So I've decided to not ignore the
+	stdisp after all. This means that it doesn't make sense to save the
+	geometry for all splits, because the statusbar moves around on
+	horizontal maximization, introducing new splits and messing with the
+	existing ones. I now use a very naive form of verification before
+	restoring the layout, which only consists in checking that all frames
+	have the FRAME_MAXED_* flag set, compare the last commit. This makes
+	things a lot easier and it should be precise enough.
+
+	TODO: The statusbar is not restored when undoing a horizontal
+	maximization. Two things are causing problems:
+	1) Simply calling a tiling_manage_stdisp or similar at the end of the
+	   restore process causes inacceptable flickering.
+	2) Resizing the statusbar will cause other windows to be resized. This
+	   will possibly lose a FRAME_MAXED_VERT flag on a frame.
+	Right now the statusbar will be automatically restored when for example
+	switching away from and back to the current workspace. Under the right
+	circumstances this causes problem 2) above.

+2012-05-02  Philipp Hartwig  <ph@phhart.de>
+
+	Mark all frames involved in a maximization as maximized
+	While this is of course not technically accurate, is has the effect that
+	we undo a maximization whenever we toggle maximization on a frame that
+	is already part of a maximized split. This is desirable for two reasons:
+
+	First, it gives the expected result on frames that have optically been
+	maximized in a maximization process but were not the one that we toggled
+	maximization on:
+	-----               -----
+	|   | vert. max. 1  | | |
+	|---| ------------> |1|2|
+	|1|2|               | | |
+	-----               -----
+	Before, trying to untoggle maximization on frame 2 would instead try to
+	maximize frame 2 which is undesirable. With the new behavior a user does
+	not have to remember on which frame he toggled maximization to undo a
+	maximization. This was explicitly requested in the discussion with the
+	subject "Toggle horizontal/vertical maximize behaviour" on ion-general.
+
+	Secondly, it even seems desirable in the following situation, where a
+	frame has not been optically maximized.
+	-----               -----
+	| 0 | vert. max. 3  | | |
+	|---| ------------> |1| |
+	|1| |               |-|3|
+	|-|3|               |2| |
+	|2| |               | | |
+	-----               -----
+	One might argue that restoring the layout when toggling vertical
+	maximization on 2 is wrong because it is not maximized yet, but
+	maximizing frame 2 in this setup would have the ugly side effect of
+	forever losing the original layout and turning frame 0 into an
+	unresponsive frame of height 0. To achieve the desired result a user
+	will now have to toggle maximization on 2 twice, first to restore the
+	actual layout and then to actually maximize it. I find this acceptable,
+	given that the end result is much cleaner.
+
+	On a side node, this commit also tries to avoid any flickering for the
+	statusbar or the dock.

+	* Added attach_params winprop and auto_placement option.
+	  The first, attach_params, is a table containing the same parameters that can
+	  be passed to WGroup.attach. It is applied when a new frame would normally be
+	  created for the window, as attach parameters of the frame. The parameters are
+	  thus not applied when attaching a new window to an existing (tiled) frame, or
+	  for attaching the window within the newly created frame.
+
+	  The second, auto_placement, is a boolean option in the attach parameters,
+	  and can be used to control whether application-supplied position is used,
+	  or whether Ion should itself calculate a position for the window.

+	More sophisticated pointer event hack.
+	Apparently the old one was needed, after all, for actions on transients.
+	So now we do like this: if the subwindow from the event listens to the
+	button/modifier combination in question at all, then we let it handle it,
+	blocking the parent. Otherwise the parent handles it.

+
+	UNDO: Removed pointer event subwindow forwarding hack.
+	Only useful use cases seem to be handled by not grabbing modifierless
+	bindings. This was stopping global (WScreen) grabs of buttons from
+	being handled if there was a frame in the way. (Note that modifierless
+	pointing device bindings are never grabbed, on purpose, so they still
+	don't work through frames or client windows.)

+
+	Use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) when available.
+	*nix provides only one interval timer (or 'select' timeout), so programs
+	with multiple timers need to do their own timeout management. This means
+	converting the times from delays to absolute times. When gettimeofday is
+	used, the time thus provided is not guaranteed to be monotonic, and may
+	be adjusted backwards, which is a serious problem. The CLOCK_MONOTONIC
+	time advanced monotonically from an unspecified starting point, thus
+	providing exactly what is needed for decent timeout management.
+
+	This partially fixes issues with e.g. statusbar updates when time is
+	adjusted backwards. If CLOCK_MONOTONIC is not available, the issue
+	remains, as I can't be arsed to write ugly countermeasures against
+	the lack of an absolutely _essential_ feature that every system that
+	is not totally moronic, should have had to begin with. (I should also
+	be just using the rather nice libevent that I just learned about
+	instead of my own mainloop library... but since there's a feature
+	freeze and the conversion would be quite a bit of work that could
+	induce new bugs, it isn't happening for Ion3.)

+
+	Ugly hack for dockapp winprop support.
+	We save the dockapp state ourselves over restarts to get the right
+	winprop after that, because the way windows are loaded after restart,
+	the dockapp state would not be easily available otherwise. In addition,
+	dockapps usually don't have any class/role/instance identification
+	information in the dockapp (icon) window, so this method can not
+	be used -- easily. Some dockapps would function fine with us simply
+	using the main window instead of the icon window as specified by
+	the dockapp protocol, and this would provide better winprop support,
+	but then other dockapps don't display anything meaningful in the
+	main window, that the expect not to be shown. Hence this ugly hack
+	for at least basic all-dockapps winprop matching. For better matching
+	dockapps should preferrably be able to start normally, as `asclock`
+	can do (an does by default), instead of the "withdrawn" mode.

+
+	Fixes to new drawing engine attribute scoring:
+	  - Since each item occurs on the attribute list only once, with a score,
+	    the a star ("*") on the source list should be used scored by its score
+	    there, instead of one. (Possibly also other items' scores should be
+	    multiplied by the source list score?)
+	  - The "activity" substyle needs some stars in it to give it a higher
+	    score over other rather specific possibilities without "no_activity"
+	    to block their use.

+
+	Added quasiactivity hint to the "clean" styles (+improved activity colour).
+	Frame padding is drawn in red when frame frame is quasiactive. Stylistically
+	it's far from ideal, but that seems to be the best place for the hint
+	without major improvements to the drawing engine. The "emboss" styles still
+	need to get this added, but they also demand other work, being largely
+	bitrotted.

+2007-01-26  Tuomo Valkonen  <tuomov@iki.fi>
+
+	Drawing engine API and attribute handling changes.
+	An attribute string is no longer passed to every drawing function,
+	but instead the attributes must be allocated from libtu's "stringstore",
+	and then set on the brush. The attributes are also no longer matched
+	linearly, but by simple containment, with the linear specification strings
+	in the style files (and gr_get_brush also still), however still modifying
+	the score a match gives. These changes should make it easier to add
+	additional attributes.

+	Ugly pointer focus hack for messy floats:
+	If a window that does not have the focus, or if the focus is being
+	changed elsewhere, is unmapped (or destroyed), contains the pointer,
+	then try to set the focus again to prevent focus from changing to
+	a window under this unampped window. (However, if the unampped window
+	has the focus, and no change elsewhere is known, current focus policy
+	dictates that the focus should fall to the underlying window.)

+
+	Removed the bitrotted Xinerama code altogether.
+	I am unlikely to waste time fixing it. However, the abstract support still
+	remains (enhanced), and someone who cares about it, will just have to write
+	a separate module to set up a special layout for the root window (now a
+	WScreen and WMPlex) with new WScreens for each Xinerama screen, and set
+	the screen ID of the root window to less than zero for the layout loading
+	code.

+
+	Made WRootWin inherit WScreen.
+	This removes some ugly hacks, and simplifies things a lot for the usual
+	case of a single screen, or that of normal X multihead. This completes
+	the bitrot of Xinerama-specific code, although abstract support for
+	various (nested) screen configurations remains (and infact there's
+	now the abstract possibility of both single-screen and multi-screen
+	workspaces/windows).

+	Placeholder and detach improvements:
+	- No need for special handling of transients in configs anymore:
+	  framing of non-WWindow regions on detach is automatic now, and
+	  an auto-destroyed frame creates a recreation WFramedPHolder for
+	  its remaining WMPlexPHolders, so that the container frame can
+	  be recreated on attach.
+	- Consequently, multiple fullscreened windows from a floating frame
+	  are now returned back to the same frame, even if the original
+	  frame was emptied (and thus destroyed) in the meanwhile.

+	startup.lua. This file redefines some of the binding setup functions
+	to monitor binding settings. If some of the binding groups have been
+	left empty by failing configuration files, minimal bindings are
+	created.

+	- The query module was removed of dependencies to WIonFrame code and
+	  is now a loadable module (query.so).
+
+	- The 'query_workspace' command by default creates workspaces of the
+	  first registered (module loaded) kind. Other kinds of workspaces can
+	  be created by prefixing workspace name with the class name (WIonWS,
+	  WFloatWS) and a colon, e.g. 'WFloatWS:foo'.
